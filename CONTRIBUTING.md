Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

First of, thank you very much for your contribution! You've made it halfway through by reading this guide üëçüéâ

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/yWorks/svg2pdf.js/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[contact at yworks dot com](mailto:contact@yworks.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

As with any software, yGuard potentially contains unanticipated bugs. We encourage bug reports! Please make sure you follow this checklist before submitting a bug report:

- check if there is any [existing issue](https://github.com/yWorks/yGuard/issues) for the bug you experience
- create a **clear** and **descriptive** issue
- describe which version of yGuard you are using
- attach a `build.xml`, `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` (depending on your setup)
- attach sample source code, if applicable

With yGuard being an open-source project and not a commercial product, we may decide not to fix certain bugs. If possible, submitting a pull request to fix the issue is much appreciated.

### Suggesting features

If you feel yGuard lacks a feature that is crucial to your workflow, please open an issue.

Please also make sure that this feature has not yet been requested.

At any time you can contribute your feature using a pull request, or comission yWorks to implement the feature for you / your organization, if you need to accelerate development.

### Pull requests

We encourage early pull requests (drafts). The yGuard team can then help you through the rest of the process, which will usually lead to inclusion of proposed changes.
When preparing a pull request, please follow these steps:

- Read the build instructions in our `README.md`
- If applicable, please add a test case for your feature / bug fix
- Make sure all the tests are passing before commiting
- Use [atomic commits](https://www.codewithjason.com/atomic-commits-testing/) to make your life easier (as well as the maintainers)
