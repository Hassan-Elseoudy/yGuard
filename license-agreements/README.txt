yGuard was transitioned from two modules (yGuard and retroguard) to one module (yGuard).
Historically the initial code of retroguard was based on Mark Welsh's work.
In version 3.0.0 we contacted all copyright holders to unify the repository.
Within this directory you can find the documents concerning the license change.
